- see Dan's examples in his git repo (SoupBowlWeb/stylesheets-challenge, https://github.com/SoupBowlWeb/stylesheets-challenge)
- note the difference between
--- <element selector> <class/id selector>
 versus
--- <element selector>.<class/id selector>
- " " means "apply to class/id found within that element OR ANY OF ITS CHILDREN"
- <es> = <element selector>
- <cids> = <class/id selector>
-- " " then " " (e.g., "x y z .abc") means "for all class abc's within z's within y's within x's"
-- another eg "ol ol" would affect all ordered lists nested within one ordered list, versus "ol" which is just the top level ordered lists
-- also can do "<cids> <es>" to say "apply to all elements within class/id"
- "." means "apply to an element of that class/id"
- " > " is a child selector. Where " " selects all descendants, " > " selects only descendants one level below the given parent
- '<es>[attribname="attribvalue"]' can be used to select on any attribute versus class and id attributes.
-- Therefore, '<es>[class="xyz"]' is the same as '<es>.xyz'
- Google the "+" character in CSS (e.g., "p+p")
